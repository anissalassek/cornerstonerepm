title: March 2024 Market Statistics
description: |-
    Just like spring, the real estate market has sprung into action! As mortgage
    interest rates stabilized in March to just under 7%, mortgage applications
    surged by 15%, indicating that buyers are feeling more comfortable the
    Federal Reserve will stay true to several potential interest rate
    drops this year.
    Statistics for the Denver Metro area show the number of pending sales at the
    end of March were 8% more than the same time last year and 33% more than
    just last month. Buyers are making decisions quicker, causing days on market
    to fall by 2 weeks to a median of 12 days actively available and due to a
    strong demand for $1 million plus priced homes, the closing price of homes
    rose more than 3% from February. March supply historically has seen an
    average of 13,376, with a high in 2006 of 27,309, a low in 2021 of 1,921 and
    this year was 5,849, still well below the average.
    The pool of current of homeowners with a mortgage, half of them are sitting
    on a rate below 4% and the prospect of having a new loan closer to 7% keeps
    the “golden handcuffs” on those who could be potential sellers and buyers.
