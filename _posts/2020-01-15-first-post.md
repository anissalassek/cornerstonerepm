title: July 2024 Market Statistics
description: >-
    More sellers are putting their properties on the market with a 68% increase
    from this same time last year and an overall close-price-to-list-price ratio
    of 98.99%.  Buyers are still discerning and playing the waiting game,
    looking forward to a supposed rate cut coming in September.  They also want
    improvements and upgrades to energy, water & space efficiency and they are
    willing to wait to find it, as evidenced by less properties closed in July
    this year compared to last year.  With elections just around the corner,
    everyone seems to be holding their breath to see what the market does.
