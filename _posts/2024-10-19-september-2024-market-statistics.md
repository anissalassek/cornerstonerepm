title: September 2024 Market Statistics
description: >-
    Median closed price dropped again to $576,171, days in the MLS increased to
    25 and closed homes dropped by almost 20%.  This time of year is usually
    slow due to families wrapping up vacations, kids starting school and
    everyone settling in for fall. There is an interesting trend growing in
    Colorado where parents are purchasing homes to be closer to children and
    grandchildren, encouraging longer and more frequent visits and freedom of
    travel.
