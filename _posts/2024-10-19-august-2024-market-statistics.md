title: August 2024 Market Statistics
description: >-
    August saw the number of closed homes drop by 7.5%, days on the market rose
    to 21 days, a 31% increase from July and the median close price dropped by
    1.67% to $590,000. Buyers are focusing on flooring that is consistent
    throughout the home, and still want a move-in ready rather than a fixer
    upper.  Sellers, understanding the market challenges are wise to offer
    compensation to a cooperating buyer's agent and being flexible in
    negotiations.
