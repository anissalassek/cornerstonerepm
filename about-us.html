                <p class="editable">Established in 2005, Cornerstone Real Estate and Property Management offers a long history of professional real estate and property management services.</p>

                <p class="editable">
                    Built on a foundation of 40 plus years of construction, architectural and real estate experience, owners Kevin and Kerri Massey know the Denver and surrounding area real estate markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kevin began his career in the construction and architectural industry at a young age helping his union electrician father with projects around the house (aka the lackey) and later pouring foundations and earning a degree in Architectural Project Management working with home builders and commercial medical architectural firms.&nbsp; This foundation helped him easily shift gears and move into real estate and property management, using the skills and knowledge acquired to be a valuable asset to his clients, especially during negotiations of a real estate transaction or when troubleshooting an issue with a rental property.<br /><br />Kevin also belongs to the Denver Metro Association of Realtors where he collaborates and builds relationships with other realtors and vendors, such as lenders, title companies, roofers, etc.&nbsp; Having access to a large group of industry partners means our clients can count on Kevin to guide them to reputable and reliable vendors.<br /><br /> Community service is a vital part of our business and Kevin belongs to the Westminster Rotary Club, which provides help locally as well as internationally!&nbsp; Kevin served as President 2019-2020, has helped select college scholarship recipients, handed out hundreds of dictionaries to elementary students, provided thousands of students with laptops, and raised money to fund many of the projects Rotary is involved in.&nbsp; Being community minded is a great way for us to keep our finger on the pulse of the metro area and be a resource to our clients.<br /><br />Kerri is the marketing guru, accounting nerd and administrative keeper (aka Kevin's boss).&nbsp; She creates our monthly newsletter, advertises properties for rent, coordinates paperwork, updates our portal, maintains the website, and all things that are the nuts and bolts of the business.&nbsp; Together, they make a great team!&nbsp;
